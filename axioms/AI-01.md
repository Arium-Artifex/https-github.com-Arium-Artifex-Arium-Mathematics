# AI-01 — The Arium: Atomic Unit of Integrity

An **Arium** 𝒜 is the smallest indivisible semantic container governed by a single sovereign natural ℕ_𝒜(t).

**Mathematical definition**  
𝒜 ≜ { knots, edges, λ_𝒜, ℐ_𝒜, ℕ_𝒜(t) }  
where  
- knots ∈ finite set K  
- edges ∈ binary relation on K (the “ropes”)  
- λ_𝒜 ∈ ℝ⁺  = total intrinsic binding measure (cumulative rope)  
- ℐ_𝒜      = local Index belonging to this Arium  
- ℕ_𝒜(t)   = sovereign natural (integrity counter) at time t

**Interpretation**  
An Arium is anything that can meaningfully be said to “hold together or fall apart”:  
a friendship triad, a triangular mesh face, a logical proposition, a crystal grain, a social media clique.

No smaller unit exists in Arium mathematics.
