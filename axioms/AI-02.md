# AI-02 — The Natural ℕ : Threshold of Integrity

The **natural** ℕ_𝒜(t) is the only measure of wholeness for Arium 𝒜.

**Values and meaning**  
+1 → perfect, unbreakable integrity  
0  → critical threshold (decision point)  
−∞ → total collapse (irreversible)
∞  → feedback paradox - integrity seemingly intact but utility has collapsed (irreversible)
existing not equal to utility, therefore ∞ ends being itself
